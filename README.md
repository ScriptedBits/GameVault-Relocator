# 🚀 Introducing GameVault-Relocator! 🎮  

We're excited to announce **[GameVault-Relocator](https://github.com/ScriptedBits/GameVault-Relocator/)** – a powerful tool designed to **seamlessly move directories** to a new destination **while automatically creating a symlink** for you!  


## Organize. Relocate. Play.
GameVault-Relocator is a passion project built to solve a real-world challenge: managing and relocating large retro gaming collections—especially those spanning multiple drives. Whether you're organizing arcade ROMs, MAME sets, or curating a LaunchBox or other emulator frontend setup, this tool helps you move games safely while keeping everything linked and playable.

With fast transfers, symlink automation, and built-in checks, it eliminates the hassle of broken paths or manual reconfiguration. Think of it as your library mover, path preserver, and retro game wrangler—all wrapped in a modern PyQt5 GUI.

No more broken shortcuts. No more “where did that ROM go?” Just clean, organized, ready-to-play fun.
## 🔹 Key Features:

✔️ Seamlessly move folders to a new drive or storage path  
✔️ Choose native file move or multithreaded Robocopy  
✔️ Automatically create symlinks to maintain compatibility  
✔️ Perfect for LaunchBox, ROM sets, MAME, and retro collections  
✔️ Modern, dark-themed UI for a smooth experience
